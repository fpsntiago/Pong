The pong game was implemented by creating green/magenta boundaries, paddles, and a ball. The game
was implemented on the FPGA using the switches as the controls and the 7 segment display as the score
tracker. Two clocks were defined, one clock bound to the paddles (slowClock) and another bound to the
ball (ballclk). PixelClock is used to handle the the signals for creating the colors sent to the computer monitor. Players 1 and 2 are defined separately and function independent of one another. The switches are defined to manipulate the positon of the paddles(Left up, Left down, Right up, and Right down). Score was kept through the use of case statement and displayed the score to the seven segment display in hexidecimal. The behavior of the ball was developed through the use of a finite state machine. The ball will always move diagonally and not in a straight line, also when contacted with a paddle the ball will only bounce back when it hits strictly the front of the paddle. Contact with the top or bottom of the paddle will not work.
